# Different types of variables
# Store a number
my_number = 80 # assigning 80 to my_number (Variable) 
print(my_number)

my_number = 7 # I have reassigned the value of the variable
print(my_number)

# Store a string
name_1= "Keanu"
print(name_1)

# Assign the value of one variable to another
my_number = name_1
print(my_number) # Don't assign values to variables that don't make sense

# Creating a new variable
num_1 = 5
num_2 = 17

'''Do calculations with variables and store the result in 
# another variable'''

sum1 = 5+17 # this is not good practice
print(sum)

# Better way
sum = num_1 + num_2
print(sum1)

sum_string1 = "17" # this stores a string
sum_string2 ="5"

sum = sum_string1+sum_string2
print(sum)

# Adding strings together is called concatenation
sum =sum_string1 + sum_string2
print(sum)
print(sum1)

print(f"my calculation for {sum_string1} + {sum_string2} = {sum1}")
